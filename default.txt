/*
 * Hi,
 * 
 * The folks at CompilePad have built the online compiler/interpreter
 * from scratch. The editor supports collaboration in real-time - which
 * means you can see the code being edited live by others. It's like the
 * Google doc for code!
 * 
 * The backend is written in PHP. 
 *
 * All the codes are run on a separate openshift server in a sandboxed
 * environment. This means it's almost impossible to compromise the server,
 * If you come across any situation where it's not so, please let us know.
 *
 * We will add more languages and continue improving it in future,
 * and would love to hear your suggestions and feeback on it. Feel free
 * to drop an email at compilepad@gmail.com or contact us at the bottom
 * of this page.
 *
 *
 *
 * P.S. If you feel this can be of some use to you, please like
 * and share it. :)
